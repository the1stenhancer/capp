Country app built entirely using jetpack compose and Android architecture components.

This project is a simple app that uses retrofit2/moshi to fetch country information from https://restcountries.com.

It makes use of Jetpack compose and it's integration with Hilt, Navigation component, ViewModel etc
It makes use of Kotlin coroutines together with some utility classes to fetch the data and make it available to compose as state to display.

Thinking in compose, state management(from state hoisting to reusability of composables), Side-effects (for showing snackbar on error from fetching data) and many more.
This project has enabled me to get really familiar with Android and some of its features and with time, I can only get better!

Used a lot of things for this project (Lunacy for the UI design, Android Studio, etc)
Making the Icon was war! :**D but I learnt a lot of things and it continues. Feel free to fork the project and roam around, post issues and lets learn together!
